It was a dark and stormy night when Sarah Chen first arrived at the old mansion. She had been hired as a private investigator to look into the mysterious disappearance of wealthy businessman John Morrison.

The mansion stood atop a hill, its Gothic architecture looming against the cloudy sky. Sarah pulled her coat tighter as she walked up the stone steps to the front door.

Inside, she met the butler, James, who had worked for the Morrison family for thirty years. His weathered face showed concern as he led her through the dimly lit hallways.
