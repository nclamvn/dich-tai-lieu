The next morning, Sarah began her investigation in earnest. She interviewed each member of the household staff, taking detailed notes in her leather journal.

The housekeeper, Mrs. Patterson, revealed that John Morrison had been acting strangely in the weeks before his disappearance. He would often lock himself in his study for hours, refusing to see anyone.

Sarah's partner, Detective Mike Rodriguez, arrived from the city with forensic equipment. Together, they examined Morrison's study, searching for clues that might explain his sudden vanishing.
